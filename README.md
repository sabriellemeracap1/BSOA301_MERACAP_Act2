# What did you learn about how WordPress stores its files and data?

WordPress stores its design and content files in folders. These include themes, plugins, and media uploads. The written content, user information, and settings are saved separately in a database. This setup helps keep the visual parts and the data organized.

# Which part was more complex: handling files or managing the database?

Managing the database was more complex. Since I did not have access to the database file, I found it harder to understand how the data is stored and exported. Uploading the files was easier because they were already organized.

# Why is version control useful for a WordPress project in an office setting?

Version control helps keep the project organized and updated. It enables team members to track changes, prevent mistakes, and collaborate effectively without losing important files. This is useful in an office setting where multiple people may need access to the website.
